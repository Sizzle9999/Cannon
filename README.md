Cannon
======

Cannon is a javascript framework that helps you interact with the HTML5 canvas.
Right now it focuses on 2Doperations, but there are many available features, including :

* drawing any kind of shape, image ortext to the canvas
* easy manipulation and animation of the displayed elements, including complex matrix transformations
* a shitload of utilities that helps you with math, gradients, events and more

It's of course standalone and hasn o dependencies. It's fully object oriented and you can easily plug in your own code
into it.

Usage
_____

Almost every function is commented inside the files, but there is currently no standalone documentation.
For examples, you can visit my blog yannick-lohse.fr, or email me at contact-at-yannick-lohse.fr - I'd love to help.

There are still plenty of things that I plan to add, and help would of course be very appreciated :)
