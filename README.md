# Cannon

Cannon is a javascript framework that helps you interact with the HTML5 canvas.
It focuses on 2D operations, but there are many available features, including :

* drawing any kind of shape, image or text to the canvas
* easy manipulation and animation of the displayed elements, including complex matrix transformations
* a shitload of utilities that helps you with math, gradients, events and more

It's of course standalone and has no dependencies. It's fully object oriented and you can easily plug your own code
into it.

## Usage

The code itself is fairly well documented, but you can also go to [the projects wiki](https://github.com/y-lohse/Cannon/wiki) for more documentation.

For more examples, you can visit my blog [yannick-lohse.fr](http://yannick-lohse.fr), or email me at contact-at-yannick-lohse.fr - I'd love to help.

There are still plenty of things that I plan to add, and help would of course be very appreciated :)
